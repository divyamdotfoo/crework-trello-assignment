# Trello implementation with nextjs, typescript and express.

- Serving static export of nextjs from express
- The application does not have much server side rendering and lacks the benefits of RSCs because the requirement was to build with express and mongo.
- Hosted on render, so please wait incase you are getting coldstarts.
